<h2>How to install it?</h2>
You have to install the following software on client computer:<br>

<ol>
 <li><a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org">TortoiseSVN (visual SVN interface for windows)</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion (console SVN applications)</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/pbscc-proxy/downloads/list">PBSCC-Proxy last featured version</a>
</ol>
<br>
<hr>
The SccProxy prompts to be installed into the same directory as TortoiseSVN . <br>

<h2>What's new?</h2>

<ul>
 <li><b>2010-02-27</b> Corrected bug whel special sumbols used in comment (like double quote).
 </li>
 <li><b>2009-08-01</b> Added parameter into registry <i>cache.ttl.seconds</i> that defines cache time to live in seconds<br>
 The environment variable LC_MESSAGES used only for subversion sessions and not for whole PB session.<br>
 Removed deprecated functionality : DDB.
 </li>
 <li><b>2008-06-22</b> Removed conflict between several PB instances while opening pipe to svn<br>
 Removed a bug when PB hangs while executing svn.
 </li>
 <li><b>2007-06-04</b> Just set flag noDDB=1 in installation by default</li>
 <li><b>2007-05-31</b> Changed LANG variable to LC_MESSAGES to avoid conflict with Sybase client.</li>
 <li><b>2007-03-20</b> On initialization, set the LANG local environment variable to "en_US" to support localized svn version (normally, after that SVN speaking english in the session of PBSCC).</li>
 <li><b>2007-02-17</b> Support of the SVN version 1.4.x.<br>
  New registry key "checkout.lock". If set to 1 then the object will be locked in addition to the property lock method.
 </li>
 
 <li><b>2006-12-03</b> New: one operation for several objects and additional error logging.</li>
 <li><b>2006-04-26</b> you can specify svn work directory through registry ( ".svn" or "_svn" ).</li>
 <li><b>2006-04-06</b> corrected a bug with TEMP environment variable. Great thanks to Stephan Glehn. Shame on me.</li>
 <li><b>2006-03-23</b> _popen function not used any more because it could work incorrectly in non console applications.</li>
 <li><b>2005-12-03</b> Removed double comment request. Commit error log is redirected to PB.</li>
 <li><b>2005-05-17</b> Added information about conflict during svn update.</li>
 <li><b>2005-05-16</b> PBSCC Proxy published.</li>
</ul>

<h2>PbSccProxy in real project</h2>
<ul>
 <li>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/aseisql/">ASE ISQL</a> is a PowerBuilder open-source project that uses the following tools to manage sources:
	<ul>
	 <li>PbSccProxy to work with subversion repository from PowerBuilder.
	 <li><a href="http://dm.char.com.ua/pb/pborca.htm">PBORCA</a> to build PowerBuilder libraries and executable from sources. So you don't need to store PBL's.
	 
	 
	</ul>
 
</ul>

<h2>Known problems:</h2>
<ul>
<li>To work with console applications (svn.exe) and to avoid console blinking, 
proxy creates console on library initialization. Sometimes (I don't know why) you could see it, but it quickly disappears.

<li>Today proxy has a simple parser of ".svn\entries" file. And if tomorrow format will be changed then proxy will not work.
<li>PowerBuilder limits SCC CheckIn command to 25 objects.</li>

<ul><li><b>Solution:</b> PowerBuilder uses an array of object file names that it passes to a source
control system in each of its SCC API requests. The SCC specification does not
mention an upper limit to the number of files that can be passed in each request,
but the default implementation in PowerBuilder limits SCC server requests to
batches of 25 objects.<br>
A PB.INI file setting allows you to override the 25-file limit on file names sent
to the source control server in a batched request. <br> 
You can make this change in the <code>[Library]</code> section of the PB.INI file by adding the following instruction:<br>
<code>SccMaxArraySize=nn</code><br>
where nn is the number of files you want PowerBuilder to include in its SCC
API batch calls. Like other settings in the PB.INI file, the SccMaxArraySize
parameter is not case sensitive.</li></ul>

<li>In PowerBuilder 11 the <code>CheckOut</code> operation could be disabled when object 
just released (<code>CheckIn</code> or <code>Undo CheckOut</code>) by other user. <br>
This is because PbSccProxy uses local cache for 1 minute (3 min in old versions) instead of requesting real status from svn. <br>
Now you can customize this value through registry <i>cache.ttl.seconds</i> value.<br>
Also you can foce PbSccProxy to request real statuses from svn by using <code>Get Latest Version</code> on required library or target.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Svn work directory:</h2>
If you are using a special version of SVN with work directory named <b>"_svn"</b> instead of <b>".svn"</b><br>
then you must do the following modification of registry:<br>
<img src="img/image000.gif"><br>

<br>


<h2>Configuration of PB:</h2>

<img src="img/image001.png"><br>

<br>

The field <b>User ID </b>helps to determine current user.
This value used nowhere in process except to check if object was checked out by
you or by another user. So you can change this value to edit object checked out
by another user.
<br>
<br>
The <b>Project</b> field should contain the folder where you
have made "<b>SVN Check Out</b>" operation:

<img src="img/image003.png" ><br>

<br>

<b>Local Root Directory</b> is a folder of your PB workspace.<br>

<br>

As you can see my project contains two subfolders. You must manually create all subfolders of your project in SVN (if you have some).

<br>

The <b>Project</b> folder must be always in status 
<b>normal</b> <img width=12 height=12 src="img/image005.gif" > when you are going to work with PB. </p>

<br>

<br>

<h2>How it works:</h2>

<br>

Today SVN supports native object locking, but this information is stored on server only and not cached in local copy.<br>
That's why I'm emulating locking using SVN properties feature. Properties are cached in the local copy<br>

<img src="img/image007.png"><br>

This means that testscc.pbt is locked by the user dmluinfo2id.<br>

<br>

To increase speed, <b>SCC Proxy</b> creates <b>cache</b> folder in the svn work directory:<br>

<img src="img/image009.png" ><br>

<img src="img/image011.png"><br>

<br>

Each file contains just two lines: revision number and value of lockby property.<br>

<img src="img/image013.png" ><br>

<br>
<h2>If you have any problems:</h2>

Use google group <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pbscc">http://groups.google.com/group/pbscc</a>
or mail at <a href="mailto:pbscc@googlegroups.com">pbscc@googlegroups.com</a>.<br>
To enable debug logging, please spesify a full path in the registry:<br>
<img src="img/image014.png"><br>
All svn commands will be logged into this file.<br>
So you can repeat them from the command shell and see where the problem appears.<br><br>
Also the file "%TEMP%\pbscc.err" created during "svn update" command.<br>
You can check it to see if you have some specific problems.<br>
