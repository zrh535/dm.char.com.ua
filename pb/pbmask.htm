<font color=maroon>In PowerBuilder version 7.0.3 build 10135 and higher this problem can be solved by  transparent GIF pictures.</font>
<br>
But if you still interested in it, here it is.
<p>
<B>Idea:</b>
<p>
The style of picture button in powerbuilder is BS_OWNERDRAW.
The owner window or userobject receives a WM_MEASUREITEM message when the button is created 
and a WM_DRAWITEM message when a visual aspect of the button has changed.
<p>
We can trigger WM_DRAWITEM event for the owner window (or userobject) to draw a
picture button into our bitmap (not to the screen).
<p>
Now we can convert a bitmap to an icon, then change the style of the picturebutton 
from BS_OWNERDRAW to BS_ICON, and set this icon to be displayed in our picturebutton.
<p>
We need an Icon to be sure that disabled icon will be shown in a right way.<br>
<img src="pbm_dis.gif">
<p>
I found some limitation. It depends on operation system, video card, etc.
The creation of large size icons will fail.
I found this limitation for windows 98. The maximum size of the icon ~ 30000 points.
300 x 100 pixels.


<hr>
Here is realization of this algorithm (not the best one, but workable).

<p>
<a href="n_picture_masker.sru">n_picture_masker.sru</a><br>
This object is autoinstantiated so you don't need to create and destroy it.
It have only two public methods:
<pre>boolean f_SetMask(pictureObject) //converts usual picturebutton to icon button
boolean f_Reset(pictureObject) //converts icon button back to picturebutton
where pictureObject can be Picture or PictureButton</pre>
<br>
I think for better performance just declare it as shared variable in your custom picturebutton 
and call f_SetMask(this) on constructor event and f_Reset(this) on destructor.
