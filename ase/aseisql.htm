<hr>

Why? As for me, the <b>SQL Advantage</b> is not handy. So I decide to create my own <b>ASE Isql</b>.<br>

<hr>
<h2><font color=red>Note: project has been moved to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/aseisql/">code.google.com/p/aseisql</a></font></h2>

<hr>
<b>Features:</b><br>
- Unicode support (UTF8)<br>
- Marker management.<br>
- Folding: expand/collapse BEGIN-END sections.<br>
- SQL object context menu (like "Open procedure" if proc name is selected).<br>
- Trigger support<br>
- Now Sybase debugger (sqldbgr) integrated<br>
- Read carefully <b>What's New</b> section because it's the only HELP document for this product.<br>

<b>Known Issues</b>
<ul>

    <li> ASE ISQL will not connect to a Sybase database using the Sybase 15 client.<br>
          o Workaround: In the Sybase 15 release, Sybase renamed libct.dll and libcs.dll to libsybct.dll and libsybcs.dll, respectively. Sybase has provided a batch command that will rename the files to pre-15 names. It's located in c:\sybase_client_install_folder\locs-15_0\scripts and the file name is copylibs.bat
</ul>
<br>
<b>Future plans:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Autocompletion with object/column names
<li>Working on Resultsets in text mode...
<li>SCC support for files.
<li>still Thinking about workspace...
</ul>
